    <p class="justified">Hi everyone, my name is Diego Mendoza. 
      I’m from a Nicaraguan background, and I speak both Spanish (native) and English (fluent). 
      I enjoy working out, and I also like making video edits mostly using DaVinci Resolve, though sometimes CapCut. 
      I’m definitely more of a night person, so if we’re hanging out, it’s probably going to be at night.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born in Florida, but was raised in Nicaragua and moved to the US 4 years ago.</li>
      <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am a junior studying computer science with a concentration in software engineering and a minor in Spanish.</li>
      <li><strong>Primary Computers:</strong> Primary Computer: Apple MacBook, macOS, laptop, portable; Windows Legion 5, Windows 11, laptop, primarily used at home.</li>
      <li><strong>Courses I’m Taking & Why:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>CTCM 2530 – Critical Thinking:</strong> It's required but I'm also interested in polishing my critical thinking skills.</li>
          <li><strong>ITIS 3135 – Front-End Web App Development:</strong> Required but I'm really interested in learning more about front-end development.</li>
          <li><strong>ITSC 3155 – Software Engineering:</strong> My concentration.</li>
          <li><strong>MATH 2164 – Matrices & Linear Algebra:</strong> Required but I can say it's the first time I'm really enjoying math.</li>
          <li><strong>PSYC 1101 – General Psychology:</strong> Required but I do find psychology interesting and useful.</li>
          <li><strong>SPAN 3220 – Spanish for Business & International Trade:</strong> My minor and even though I do speak native Spanish I find it very cool to have a class to learn about businesses in Spanish.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me by:</strong> I'm very sarcastic and I like to mess around, some years ago a friend got me into watching the vampire diaries and now I'm rewatching it for the third time because I never finished it.</li>
    </ul>
